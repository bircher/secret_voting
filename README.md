# Secret Voting Feature
This feature allows basic secret voting.
The principles are quite simple and imitate the process of voting on paper.
Instead of a paper, a voter receives a secret token that gets hashed with
two different salts to verify that the vote is valid but do not allow inferring
which ballot belongs to which voter.
