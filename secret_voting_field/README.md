# Secret Voting Fields
This module provides the fields for the secret voting question and answers.
It is used by the secret voting feature which attaches the field to a voting
node and a ballot entity.
Should the question ever need to be more complicated, this is the place to do so.
More complicated questions could include ordering of the votes for example.
